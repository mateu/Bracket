0. Get the Application:
  git clone http://github.com/mateu/Bracket.git

1. Create a database in MySQL or PostgreSQL (call it bracket_2010 if you like)
sql> create database bracket_2010

1b. If your database fu sucks or is lazy then use a SQLite database which will
create the DB for you and does not require a user or password.

2. Edit bracket.conf to match your database and user/pass (SQLite users do nothing)

3. Deploy the database, initialize it and create an admin user all in one by running:
     script/deploy_bracket.pl

4. Start it up:
     script/bracket_server.pl
For production you might want to configure a front-end sever (pimp #catalyst for help)

5. Login with your admin account at:
  http://localhost:3000

6. Let players know about your bracket.  They can register at /register
